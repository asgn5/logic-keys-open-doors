# logic-keys-open-doors
## Project 2

### Assignment
Due: Feb. 13th

Now that you have played the puzzle games (at logic-puzzles.org) write the program for it.

Your program will introduce one puzzle only, but your code should be written such that it can be easily extended to offer more puzzles.

Note that, as part of the GUI,  you need to provide clues, clear errors, and hints; the same way that was given in the puzzles you solved. However, the GUI can be a simple one (i.e. if it can't be in tabs, then even hints can be just part of the window and shown when user asks for it).

Start with an easy puzzle with 3x4 grid.
